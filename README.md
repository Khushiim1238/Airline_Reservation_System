# Airline_Reservation_System
 The **Airline Reservation System** is a Java-based project designed to simulate the functionality of an airline booking system. It allows users to search for flights, book tickets, manage reservations, and view flight details. The system typically includes features like user authentication, flight scheduling, seat selection, and payment processing.  
### Key Features: 
1. **User Authentication**: Login/Signup for passengers and admin.
2. **Flight Management**: Admins can add, update, or delete flights.
3. **Search & Booking**: Users can search for available flights and book tickets.
4. **Seat Selection**: Choose seats from available options.
5. **Reservation Management**: View, modify, or cancel bookings.
6. **Payment Integration**: Simulated payment process for ticket booking.
### Technologies Used: - 
**Java** (Core Java, Swing/AWT for GUI or Spring Boot for web-based) 
- **MySQL** or any database for storing flight and user data.
- **JDBC** or **Hibernate** for database connectivity.
 ### GitHub Repository: -
Include a `README.md` with setup instructions, features, and screenshots. - Use proper folder structure (e.g., `src` for source code, `lib` for dependencies). - Add comments in the code for better understanding.  This project is ideal for beginners to practice Java, database management, and object-oriented programming concepts.
